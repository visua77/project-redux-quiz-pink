# Redux quiz group project

During the two days you're in Stockholm, your team's task is to build a quiz game using Redux. It's a multiple choice quiz, so you'll need to define your own questions and a bunch of possible answers to present to your users.

It's up to your team to decide what your quiz should be about! You could come up with something fun and whacky like the [Buzzfeed quizes](https://www.buzzfeed.com/quizzes), or you could test your user's general knowledge with [trivia questions](https://www.opinionstage.com/blog/trivia-questions/).
